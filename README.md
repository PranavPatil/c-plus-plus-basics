# C++ Programming Basics

1. Write a class complex with data members as real and imaginary numbers and member functions as read, print, add, subtract, multiply and divide.
2. Write a class to handle two dimensional array with data members is dynamically growing two dimensional array and member functions transpose, inverse, multiplication, symmetric check, skew check or for the magic square.
3. Write a class to handle character array with data members is array and member functions are read display, concat, substring, equal and also use constructors like string s1, s2("ab") & destructor.
4. Modify the class complex program 1 to tackle operator overloading.
5. Modify the class string in program 2 to tackle operator overloading and write a main program to sort array of strings.
6. Multiple Classes Use Case
    1. Write a class date with data members dd,mm,yy and member functions read and write the date.
    2. Write a class person friend of date class with data mem name, birth date,& functions read, write
    3. Write class employee derived from person class, data mem company, salary, dept, funs read, write
    4. Write class student derived from person class, data mem percent, branch and functions read, write
    5. Write a class Empoy_Student derived from both class student and employee
